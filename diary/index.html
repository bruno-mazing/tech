  <h1><a href="./">Bruno Mazing</a> Diary</h1></header>

  <h3>Week of 18 December</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>PostgreSQL Exercises (<a href="https://pgexercises.com/">link</a>). Worked on Aggregates.</li>
    <li>Went back to the Andy Pavlo course on "Intro to Database Systems" (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLSE8ODhjZXjaKScG3l0nuOiDTTqpfnWFf">link</a>). Lectures 2, 3.</li>
    <li>May also want to check out the book "Operating System Concepts" (<a href="https://codex.cs.yale.edu/avi/os-book/OS10/index.html">link</a>).</li>

  </ul>

  <h3>Week of 11 December</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>NeurIPS in New Orleans. Kinda wish I went to more of the invited speaker talks.</li>
<li>Database System Concepts book by Silberschatz, Korth, Sudarshan (<a href="https://www.db-book.com">link</a>). Looked at first three chapters: Intro, Intro to the Relational Model, Intro to SQL.</li>
    </ul>
  <

  <h3>Week of 4 December</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>PostgreSQL Exercises (<a href="https://pgexercises.com/">link</a>). These are really nice, and more focused than leetcode. Completed the Basic, Joins and Subqueries, and Modifying Data sections.</li>
    <li>The Data Warehouse Toolkit book, first five chapters: <a href="https://www.kimballgroup.com/data-warehouse-business-intelligence-resources/books/data-warehouse-dw-toolkit/">link</a>. Dimensional modeling approach and slowly changing dimensions.</li>
    <li>Data Engineering with Python, by Crickard (<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Data-Engineering-Python-datasets-pipelines/dp/183921418X">link</a>), first few chapters. Requires a lot of things to be installed. But can probably get the gist of things without installing everything.</li>

  </ul>


  <h3>Week of 27 November</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Briefly looked into some resources on AirFlow:
      <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Data-Pipelines-Apache-Airflow-Harenslak/dp/1617296902">Book</a>: Seems like a thorough account, with generalities about data pipelines and an explanation of best practices. Chapter 17 is specifically about Azure. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vEApEfa8HXk&list=PL79i7SgJCJ9hf7JgG3S-3lOpsk2QCpWkD">Youtube Playlist</a>: watched the first video outlining the benefits of Azure. Not sure how good the remaining videos are. <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/deploying-apache-airflow-in-azure-to-build-and-run-data-pipelines/">Post</a> on deploying Airflow in Azure.
    </li>
    <li>Notes on ETL processes based on these videos <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sLhInuwdwcc">video 1</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jw4Or_FiT7k
      ">video 2</a>, by the Seattle Data Guy</li>

    <li>Plan to look into DBT: <a href="https://www.getdbt.com/">link</a>.</li>
    <li>Started watching this tutorial on Azure fundamentals from Free Code camp: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NKEFWyqJ5XA">link</a>. Some parts are nice, but not sure to what extent it will explain how to run code in Azure.</li>
    <li>Quant interview questions from Crack's book "Heard on the street", Chapter 4. Also from "A Practical Guide to Quantitative Finance Interviews."</li>
    <li>A book on information retrieval to look into: <a href="https://nlp.stanford.edu/IR-book/information-retrieval-book.html">link</a>.</li>

</li>

<li>For later: look at this course on APIs for beginners: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXsD0ZgxjRw">link</a>.</li>
<li>For later: this course on Azure might also be useful: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3qmqUZJ7l0">link</a>.</li>
