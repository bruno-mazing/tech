  <h1><a href="./">Bruno Mazing</a> Diary</h1></header>

  <h3>Week of 30 October</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Notes on bias and variance in statistical learning. Bias-variance decomposition of the test error in regression; partial analogue for classification.</li>
    <li>Thinking about models for classification, such as logistic regression, linear discriminant analysis, quadratic discriminant analysis, and naive Bayes. Started writing notes on this.</li>
    <li>Some leetcode, including the "Poor Pigs" problem.</li>
    <li>"Docker in Action" book by  Jeff Nickoloff and Stephen Kuenzli.</li>
    <li>Something I may delve into: Recommender Systems (<a href="https://towardsdatascience.com/recommender-systems-a-complete-guide-to-machine-learning-models-96d3f94ea748">link</a>). Content-base versus collaborative filtering approaches.</li>
  </ul>



  <h3>Week of 2 October</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Plan to review basics of machine learning from several textbooks.</li>
    <li>Leetcode and Geeks for Geeks coding problems.</li>
    <li>Work on behavioral interview preparation.</li>
  </ul>


  <h3>Week of 25 September</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Chapter 11 of Dive Into Deep learning: "Attention Mechanisms and Transformers".</li>
    <li>Came across this paper about "Formal algorithms for transformers" (<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.09238.pdf">link</a>).</li>
    <li>Worked on the IMDB movie reviews data set with a LSTM network.</li>
    <li>Chapter 16 of A Philosophy of Software Design.</li>
    <li>Looked briefly at: Scalars are universal: equivariant machine learning, structured like classical physics (<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2106.06610.pdf">arxiv</a>).</li>
    <li>Read several sections of this one somewhat carefully: Sign and basis invariant networks for spectral graph representation learning (<a href="https://openreview.net/pdf?id=Q-UHqMorzil">link</a>).</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Week of 18 September</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Looked into resources for scikit-learn (particularly tutorials on the official <a href="https://scikit-learn.org/stable/index.html">website</a>), but didn't delve deeply.</li>
    <li>Recurrent NNs from Chapters 9 and 10 in Dive Into Deep Learning.</li>
    <li>Thoughts about a quiver approach to recurrent neural networks (combine two networks).</li>
    <li>Started playing around with the IMDB movie reviews data set on Kaggle. Created tokens, but need to eliminate irrelevant ones.</li>
    <li>Coursera IBM course on Cloud Computing. Skimmed the videos. Opened IBM Cloud and AWS accounts.</li>
    <li>Started the Coursera IBM Course on Intro to Agile Development and Scrum.</li>
    <li>Learned about TechWorld with Nana (<a href="https://www.techworld-with-nana.com/">link</a>).</li>
    <li>Worked on Kaggle: IMDB Dataset of 50K Movie Reviews (<a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/lakshmi25npathi/imdb-dataset-of-50k-movie-reviews">link</a>). Processed the data into tokens, set-up an RNN with LSTM, but there are still issues with the training.</li>
    <li>Looked into Python Developer jobs.</li>
    <li>Chapters 14-15 from Philosophy of Software Design.</li>
    <li><b>Later option</b>: complete cloud accounts with credit card information.</li>
</ul>


<h3>Week of 11 September</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Introduction to DevOps, Coursera IBM. Audited the course, watched all videos, did all free assignments.</li>
    <li>Dive into Deep Learning, read through Chapters 1-5. Some parts I read carefully, others I skipped over.</li>
    <li>PyTorch reminders.</li>
    <li>2-3 leetcode problems per day.</li>
    <li>Reworked problems from a coding interview.</li>
    <li>Chapters 10-13 from <a href="https://web.stanford.edu/~ouster/cgi-bin/book.php">A Philosophy of Software Design</a> by  John Ousterhout.</li>
    <li>15 or so problems from <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Heard-Street-Quantitative-Questions-Interviews/dp/0994103867">Heard on the Street</a> book with quant finance interview questions.</li>
    <li><b>Later option</b>: look at <a href="https://www.amazon.com/DevOps-Handbook-World-Class-Reliability-Organizations/dp/1950508404">The DevOps Handbook</a>.</li>
</ul>
